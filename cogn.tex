\section{decision making}
\subsection{Kahneman and Gigerenzer}

"The psychologies of Gigerenzer on the one, and of Kahneman and Tversky on the other hand are both birtually the same fundamentally different. Both approaches consider decision making the main approach to investigate human psychology.Both also agree that human decision making is directed by heuristics and offer explanations on how and why these heuristics work, and how they relate to one another. However, it is impossible to theorize about decision making without utilities and probabilityies in Kahneman and Tversky's worldview, where in Gigerenzer's worldview it is impossible to theorize  about decision making  with utilities and probabilities."\cite{Heukelom2005}\\
